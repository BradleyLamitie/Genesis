Genesis
Bradley Lamitie

How to run the game: 
To launch the game, run the genesis.py file. 

I also included a guide to beat the game. 

Known Glitches:
- Sometimes enemies disappear into walls
- Occasionally enemies move unnaturally fast
- Player Sprite warps when attacking
- Enemies sometimes move away from player, rather than towards
- When the player gets a spell/potion, the display doesn't update dynamically
- Collision detection for Patience's attacks are inaccurate
- When a player grabs an item, they pick up all the items in the room
