This was one of my favoorite classes that I took while attending Marist College. 
The class was taught by Ron Coleman and we worked on a single game across the semester.

Most students chose something a little simpler like games like Brick Breaker or Flappy Bird, but I got a bit carried away and devoted a lot of time to make a top-down game similar to Zelda. 

The project quickly grew as I added more and more to it. I even wrote a strategy guide and documentation to support it. My professor and classmates were impressed, so after the semester completed, I added additional content and presented the game at the Hudson Valley Game Conference. 

Maybe if I get the time, I'll add more to it and publish it one day, but it may need a full refactor :P 
Some things I would improve if I had the time: 
- Use a spritesheet to avoid needing multiple separate sprite images
- Adding a spritesheet would also allow me to script the import of each sprite. (Currently the first 1k lines are importing sprites)
- Break the code into separate classes. (Not sure what I was thinking at the time, but 4k lines of code is unmanageable in a single file)
- Smooth out animations
- Add walking and running frames

To run: 
- Install pygame and Python
- Clone the repo
- Run the file 'genesis.py' to start the game!
